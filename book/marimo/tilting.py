    Can you give some guidance on how to include constraints in cvxrisk?
    It doesn't seem to appear in the short documentation.
    For specificity, here's a question related to price-earnings "tilts".
    I illustrate it with a toy example.

    Let S be a sample covariance matrix, let w_SP be the (market cap) weights of stocks in the S&P 500 index
    and let V be a vector of earning-price normalized "z-scores".  I want to solve the following for w:

    Minimize (w - w_SP).transpose @ S @ (w - w_SP)

    subject to:

    w >= 0

    sum(w) = 1

    w.dot(V) = 0.5

    The exercise is to find a portfolio that is "close" to the S&P 500 index but
    has lower price-earnings ratios, a "value" tilt.  I can work through this in cvxpy,
    somewhat laboriously, but can cvxrisk accommodate these constraints easily?

    We shall first observe that if we drop the constraint w.dot(V)
    the optimal vector is just w = w_SP assuming that w_SP >= 0 and sum(w_SP) = 1.
