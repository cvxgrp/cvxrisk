We provide an abstract `RiskModel` class. The class is designed to be used in conjunction with [cvxpy](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy).
Using this class, we can formulate a function computing a standard minimum variance portfolio as

```python
import cvxpy as cp

from cvx.risk import RiskModel

def minimum_variance(w: cp.Variable, risk_model: RiskModel) -> cp.Problem:
    """Constructs a minimum variance portfolio.

    Args:
        w: cp.Variable representing the portfolio weights.
        risk_model: A risk model.

    Returns:
        A convex optimization problem.
    """
    return cp.Problem(
        cp.Minimize(risk_model.estimate_risk(w)),
        [cp.sum(w) == 1, w >= 0]
    )
```

The risk model is injected into the function.
The function is not aware of the precise risk model used.
All risk models are required to implement the `estimate_risk` method.

## A first example

A first example is a risk model based on the sample covariance matrix.
We construct the risk model as follows

```python
import numpy as np
import cvxpy as cp

from cvx.risk.sample import SampleCovariance

riskmodel = SampleCovariance(num=2)
riskmodel.cov.value = np.array([[1.0, 0.5], [0.5, 2.0]])

w = cp.Variable(2)

minimum_variance(w, riskmodel).solve()
print(w.value)
```

The risk model and the actual optimization problem are decoupled.
This is good practice and keeps the code clean and maintainable.

## Risk models

### Sample covariance

We offer two variants of the sample covariance risk model.
The first variant is the `SampleCovariance` class.
It relies on cxxpy's `quad_form` function to compute the variance
```math
w^T \Sigma w.
```
The second variant is the `SampleCovariance_product` class.
It relies on cxxpy's `sum_of_squares` function to compute the variance using
```math
\| \Sigma^{1/2} w \|_2.
```


### Factor risk models

Factor risk models use the projection of the weight vector into a lower
dimensional subspace, e.g. each asset is the linear combination of $k$ factors.
```math
r_i = \sum_{j=1}^k \beta_{ij} f_j + \epsilon_i
```
XXX: Check whether $\beta_{ij}$ or $\beta_{ji}$.
The factor time series are $f_1, \ldots, f_k$. The loadings are the coefficients $\beta_{ij}$.
The residual returns $\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be uncorrelated with the factors.

Any position $w$ in weight space corresponds to a position $f = \beta w$ in factor space.
Factor space has only $k$ dimensions, whereas weight space has $n$ dimensions.
The variance for a position $w$ is the sum of the variance of the
systemic returns explained by the factors and the variance by the idiosyncratic returns.

```math
Var(r) = Var(\beta w) + Var(\epsilon w)
```

We assume the residual returns are uncorrelated and hence

```math
Var(r) = f^T \Sigma_f f + \sum_i w_i^2 Var(\epsilon_i)
```

XXX: Explore alignment of equations.

where $\Sigma_f$ is the covariance matrix of the factors and $Var(\epsilon_i)$
is the variance of the idiosyncratic returns.

Again we offer two variants of the factor risk model reflecting what is widely used in practice.
The first variant is the `FundamentalFactorRiskModel` class.
Here the user provides the factor covariance matrix $\Sigma_f$,
the loadings $\beta$ and the volatilities of the idiosyncratic returns $\epsilon_i$. Often such
data is provided by the external parties, e.g. Barra or Axioma.

The second variant is the `TimeseriesFactorRiskModel` class.
Here the user provides the factor time series $f_1, \ldots, f_k$, usually obtained from
a principal component analysis (PCA) of the asset returns. The loadings $\beta$ are computed
via a linear regression of the asset returns on the factor time series.
The volatilities of the idiosyncratic returns $\epsilon_i$ are computed as the standard deviation
of the residuals of the linear regression.
The factor covariance matrix $\Sigma_f$ may even be diagonal in this case as the factors are orthogonal.

### cvar

XXX: Conditional value at risk
Relies on cxxpy's `sum_largest` function.




## Poetry

We assume you share already the love for [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org). Once you have installed poetry you can perform

```bash
poetry install
```

to replicate the virtual environment we have defined in pyproject.toml.

## Kernel

We install [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) within your new virtual environment. Executing

```bash
./create_kernel.sh
```

constructs a dedicated [Kernel](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) for the project.
