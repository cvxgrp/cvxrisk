    This function identifies rows and columns in a matrix that contain non-finite values
    (NaN or infinity) on the diagonal and removes them, returning both the indicator
    vector and the resulting valid submatrix.

    Args:
        matrix: An n x n matrix to be validated

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
            - Boolean vector indicating which rows/columns are valid
            - The valid submatrix with invalid rows/columns removed

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the input matrix is not square
