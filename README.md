## üìã Overview

cvxrisk is a Python library for portfolio risk management using convex optimization.
It provides a flexible framework for implementing various risk models that
can be used with [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy) to solve portfolio
optimization problems.

The library is built around an abstract `Model` class that standardizes
the interface for different risk models, making it easy to swap between
them in your optimization problems.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI (without any convex solver)
pip install cvxrisk

# Install with Clarabel solver
pip install cvxrisk[clarabel]

# Install with Mosek solver
pip install cvxrisk[mosek]

# For development installation
git clone https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxrisk.git
cd cvxrisk
make install

# For experimenting with the notebooks (after cloning)
make marimo
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning!** The package does not install a convex solver if not explicitly desired.
It relies on cvxpy-base. If you use cvxrisk as a dependency
in your projects you may want to install [clarabel](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/Clarabel.rs)
using `pip install cvxrisk[clarabel]` or [mosek](https://www.mosek.com)
using `pip install cvxrisk[mosek]`.

## üîß Quick Start

cvxrisk makes it easy to formulate and solve portfolio optimization problems:

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np
from cvx.risk.sample import SampleCovariance
from cvx.portfolio import minrisk_problem

# Create a risk model
riskmodel = SampleCovariance(num=2)

# Update the model with data
riskmodel.update(
    cov=np.array([[1.0, 0.5], [0.5, 2.0]]),
    lower_assets=np.zeros(2),
    upper_assets=np.ones(2)
)

# Define portfolio weights variable
weights = cp.Variable(2)

# Create and solve the optimization problem
problem = minrisk_problem(riskmodel, weights)
problem.solve()

# Print the optimal weights
print(weights.value)  # [0.75, 0.25]
```

## üìä Features

cvxrisk provides several risk models:

### Sample Covariance

The simplest risk model based on the sample covariance matrix:

```python
from cvx.risk.sample import SampleCovariance

riskmodel = SampleCovariance(num=2)
riskmodel.update(cov=np.array([[1.0, 0.5], [0.5, 2.0]]))
```

### Factor Risk Models

Factor models reduce dimensionality by projecting asset returns onto a
smaller set of factors:

```python
from cvx.risk.factor import FactorModel
from cvx.risk.linalg import pca

# Compute principal components
factors = pca(returns, n_components=10)

# Create and update the factor model
model = FactorModel(assets=25, k=10)
model.update(
    cov=factors.cov.values,
    exposure=factors.exposure.values,
    idiosyncratic_risk=factors.idiosyncratic.std().values
)
```

Factor risk models use the projection of the weight vector into a lower
dimensional subspace, e.g. each asset is the linear combination of $k$ factors.

$$r_i = \sum_{j=1}^k f_j \beta_{ji} + \epsilon_i$$

The factor time series are $f_1, \ldots, f_k$. The loadings are the coefficients
$\beta_{ji}$.
The residual returns $\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be uncorrelated with the factors.

Any position $w$ in weight space projects to a position $y = \beta^T w$ in
factor space. The variance for a position $w$ is the sum of the variance of the
systematic returns explained by the factors and the variance of the
idiosyncratic returns.

$$Var(r) = Var(\beta^T w) + Var(\epsilon w)$$

We assume the residual returns are uncorrelated and hence

$$Var(r) = y^T \Sigma_f y + \sum_i w_i^2 Var(\epsilon_i)$$

where $\Sigma_f$ is the covariance matrix of the factors and $Var(\epsilon_i)$
is the variance of the idiosyncratic returns.

### Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)

CVaR measures the expected loss in the worst-case scenarios:

```python
from cvx.risk.cvar import CVar

model = CVar(alpha=0.95, n=50, m=14)
model.update(returns=historical_returns)
```
